# 🚄 Train Booking System – Fast Track to Java Web Dev

A beginner-friendly Java web application that mimics a real-world train reservation system. Designed with modularity and simplicity in mind, it lets users explore train schedules, manage bookings, and simulate ticketing—all powered by servlets and JSPs with mock data.

## 🔍 Core Highlights

- 🔐 Basic authentication (Login/Register)
- 🚉 Train search by route
- 🎟️ Ticket booking & cancellation
- 🗂️ Booking overview per user
- 🛠️ Admin features (optional/expandable)
